# David's Overview

Hi, my name is David I. Akins. I am an aspiring astronomer who loves to code, and I've been coding for over 3 years now.

My passion for programming started in 2020, the same year I got an account on [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org), a free and world-class education for anyone anywhere, which my dad had introduced me to.

In only 2 and and a half of a year, I gained the following skills:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- React.js
- Next.js
- Solid.js
- p5.js (I just started learning this)
- Three.js (I just started learning this)
- [Gamification.js](https://github.com/gooddavvy/gamification-js) (this is my package, get it?)
- GoLang
- Fiber in GoLang (started learning)
- V (I'm just interested, don't know much)
- Python (I quit using this language)
- SQL (I learned this from Khan Academy)
- Git
- Markdown

Whoah, that's a long list! Interestingly, I gained all that knowledge in less than 3 years.

**Follower Achievement: I finally made it to 3k+ following! I beat this record 1 times 3,000 on Replit.**
